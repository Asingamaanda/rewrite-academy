Welcome to this lesson on limits, presented by Asi.

Let's examine the function f of x equals x squared minus 1, divided by x minus 1.

What happens when x approaches 1?

If we substitute x equals 1 directly, we get 0 over 0, which is undefined. So we need a different approach.

Let's factor the numerator.

Notice that x minus 1 appears in both the numerator and denominator.

We can cancel these terms, as long as x is not equal to 1.

After cancellation, we're left with simply x plus 1.

Now we can safely substitute x equals 1. One plus one equals 2.

Therefore, the limit as x approaches 1 equals 2.

This is the fundamental concept of limits.

Let's visualize this concept with a graph to deepen our understanding.

Here's the simplified function, f of x equals x plus 1.

Notice there's a hole at x equals 1, because the original function was undefined there.

But as we approach x equals 1 from either side, the function gets closer and closer to 2.

Both paths lead to the value 2, which is our limit.

Let's try one more example to solidify your understanding.

Find the limit as x approaches 2 of x squared minus 4, divided by x minus 2.

Try it yourself first!

Let's solve it step by step.

We factor the numerator as x minus 2, times x plus 2.

Cancel x minus 2.

We're left with x plus 2.

Substitute x equals 2. Two plus two equals 4.

Excellent! The limit equals 4.

Let's review the key concepts about limits.

Limits describe function behavior as x approaches a value.

Direct substitution may give 0 over 0, which is undefined.

Factor and simplify to remove the problem.

The limit is the value the function approaches.
