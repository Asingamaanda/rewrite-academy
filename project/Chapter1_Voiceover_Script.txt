Welcome to Grade 9 Mathematics, Chapter 1: Whole Numbers.

[PAUSE]

In this lesson, we'll explore the fundamental concepts of numbers, learn 
essential calculation techniques, and solve real-world problems involving 
ratios, rates, and proportions.

[PAUSE]

Let's begin!


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SCENE 2: SECTION 1 TITLE - TYPES OF NUMBERS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Section 1: Types of Numbers

[PAUSE]


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SCENE 3: NATURAL NUMBERS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Let's start with natural numbers. These are the numbers we use for 
counting: one, two, three, four, and so on.

Natural numbers have special properties. When you add two natural numbers, 
you always get another natural number. For example, seven plus nine 
equals sixteen.

The same is true for multiplication. Six times eight equals forty-eight, 
which is also a natural number.

We say that natural numbers are "closed" under addition and multiplication.

However, natural numbers are NOT closed under subtraction. If we try to 
calculate five minus twenty, we can't get a natural number as the answer.


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SCENE 4: WHOLE NUMBERS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Whole numbers are simply natural numbers plus zero.

Notice how zero is highlighted here. It's a very special number!

Zero is called the "identity element" for addition. When you add zero to 
any number, the number stays the same. Twenty-four plus zero equals 
twenty-four. One fifty-seven plus zero equals one fifty-seven.

Adding zero doesn't change the value!


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SCENE 5: INTEGER NUMBERS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Now let's extend our number system to include integers. Integers are 
whole numbers PLUS negative numbers.

Look at the number line. Integers extend in both directions, from negative 
infinity on the left, through zero in the middle, to positive infinity 
on the right.

Now subtraction always works! Five minus eight equals negative three. 
One hundred minus one sixty-five equals negative sixty-five.

Integers also give us additive inverses. Twenty plus negative twenty 
equals zero. One thirty-five plus negative one thirty-five equals zero.

These pairs of numbers that add to zero are called additive inverses of 
each other.


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SCENE 6: RATIONAL NUMBERS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Let's solve a real problem. Five people want to share twelve chocolate 
bars equally. How much does each person get?

Twelve divided by five doesn't give us a whole number. But we can express 
the answer as a fraction: twelve-fifths, or as a decimal: two point four.

This is where rational numbers come in. A rational number is any number 
that can be written as a fraction - one integer divided by another integer.

Three-quarters equals zero point seven five. Twenty-three tenths equals 
two point three. Both fractions and decimals are rational numbers.


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SCENE 7: IRRATIONAL NUMBERS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Here's an interesting question. What number, multiplied by itself, 
equals two?

One times one equals one - too small.
Two times two equals four - too big.
We can try decimal numbers, but we'll never find an exact fraction that 
works.

The answer is the square root of two, which is approximately one point 
four one four two one. But this decimal goes on forever without repeating!

Numbers like this, that cannot be written as fractions, are called 
irrational numbers.

Other examples include the square root of three, the square root of five, 
and the famous number pi.


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SCENE 8: SECTION 2 TITLE - CALCULATIONS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Section 2: Calculations with Whole Numbers

[PAUSE]


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SCENE 9: ESTIMATING AND ROUNDING
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

A shop owner wants to buy chickens at thirty-eight rand each. With ten 
thousand rand, can he buy two hundred and fifty chickens?

Let's estimate by rounding. Thirty-eight rand rounds to forty rand. Two 
hundred and fifty times forty equals ten thousand rand exactly!

So yes, he can buy about two hundred and fifty chickens, maybe even a 
bit more!

Now let's calculate exactly. Ten thousand divided by thirty-eight equals 
two hundred and sixty-three point one five.

He can buy two hundred and sixty-three chickens!

Estimation gives us a quick answer, and then we can calculate precisely 
if needed.


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SCENE 10: COLUMN ADDITION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Let's learn how to add large numbers using columns. We'll calculate 
thirty-seven fifty-eight plus fifty-four eighty-six.

First, we write the numbers in columns, lining up the place values.

Start with the units column. Eight plus six equals fourteen. Write four 
in the units place, and carry one to the tens column.

In the tens column: five plus eight plus the carried one equals fourteen. 
Write four, carry one.

Hundreds: seven plus four plus one equals twelve. Write two, carry one.

Thousands: three plus five plus one equals nine.

The answer is nine thousand, two hundred and forty-four!


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SCENE 11: COLUMN MULTIPLICATION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Multiplying large numbers in columns is similar to addition. Let's 
multiply thirty-four eighty-nine by forty-seven.

First, multiply thirty-four eighty-nine by seven. This gives us twenty-four 
thousand, four hundred and twenty-three.

Next, multiply thirty-four eighty-nine by forty. This equals one hundred 
and thirty-nine thousand, five hundred and sixty.

Finally, add these two results together.

The final answer is one hundred and sixty-three thousand, nine hundred 
and eighty-three!


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SCENE 12: LONG DIVISION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Long division requires breaking the problem into manageable steps. Let's 
divide thirteen thousand, two hundred and fifty-four by fifty-six.

First estimate: How many fifty-sixes fit into thirteen thousand two 
hundred and fifty-four? About two hundred. Two hundred times fifty-six 
equals eleven thousand, two hundred.

Subtract this from thirteen thousand two hundred and fifty-four. We get 
two thousand and fifty-four remaining.

Next estimate: Thirty times fifty-six equals one thousand, six hundred 
and eighty. Subtract this to get three hundred and seventy-four.

Final estimate: Six times fifty-six equals three hundred and thirty-six. 
We're left with a remainder of thirty-eight.

Add up our estimates: two hundred plus thirty plus six equals two hundred 
and thirty-six.

So thirteen thousand two hundred and fifty-four divided by fifty-six equals 
two hundred and thirty-six, with a remainder of thirty-eight.


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SCENE 13: SECTION 3 TITLE - MULTIPLES AND FACTORS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Section 3: Multiples and Factors

[PAUSE]


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SCENE 14: LCM EXAMPLE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Let's find the Lowest Common Multiple, or LCM, of six and fifteen.

Multiples of six are: six, twelve, eighteen, twenty-four, thirty, and so on.
Multiples of fifteen are: fifteen, thirty, forty-five, sixty, and so on.

The common multiples are the numbers that appear in both lists: thirty, 
sixty, ninety.

The smallest common multiple is thirty. Therefore, the LCM of six and 
fifteen is thirty!


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SCENE 15: HCF EXAMPLE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Now let's find the Highest Common Factor, or HCF, of two thousand three 
hundred and ten, and three thousand five hundred and ten.

First, we break each number into prime factors.

Two thousand three hundred and ten equals two times three times five 
times seven times eleven.

Three thousand five hundred and ten equals two times three times three 
times five times thirteen.

The common prime factors are two, three, and five.

Multiply these together: two times three times five equals thirty.

The HCF is thirty!


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SCENE 16: SECTION 4 TITLE - RATIO, RATE AND PROPORTION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Section 4: Ratio, Rate, and Proportion

[PAUSE]


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SCENE 17: APPLE PICKING RATE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Moeneba picks apples at a rate of five apples per minute.

This is an example of a rate - a quantity per unit of time.

How many apples will Moeneba pick in fifteen minutes?

Simply multiply: five apples per minute times fifteen minutes equals 
seventy-five apples!

Rates help us predict quantities over time.


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SCENE 18: BISCUIT RATIO
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

A biscuit recipe uses ingredients in a specific ratio. For every five 
parts of flour, we need two parts of oatmeal and one part of cocoa powder.

We write this ratio as five to two to one.

If we're using five hundred grams of flour, how much of each ingredient 
do we need?

The total ratio parts are five plus two plus one, which equals eight parts.

Five hundred grams divided by five parts equals one hundred grams per part.

Oatmeal: two parts times one hundred grams equals two hundred grams.
Cocoa: one part times one hundred grams equals one hundred grams.

Ratios help us scale recipes perfectly!


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SCENE 19: SPEED, DISTANCE, TIME
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Speed, distance, and time are related by a simple formula.

Speed equals distance divided by time.
Distance equals speed times time.
And time equals distance divided by speed.

Let's solve a problem. A car travels three hundred and sixty kilometers 
in exactly four hours. What is the speed?

Using our formula: Speed equals distance divided by time. Speed equals 
three hundred and sixty kilometers divided by four hours.

The speed is ninety kilometers per hour!


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SCENE 20: PROPORTION PROBLEM
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Let's combine what we've learned about rates and proportions.

Three people pick apples at different rates. Moeneba picks at five apples 
per minute, Kate at fifteen per minute, and Garth at twelve per minute.

In ten minutes, how many apples will they pick altogether?

Moeneba: five times ten equals fifty apples.
Kate: fifteen times ten equals one hundred and fifty apples.
Garth: twelve times ten equals one hundred and twenty apples.

Total: fifty plus one fifty plus one twenty equals three hundred and 
twenty apples!


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SCENE 21: CHAPTER SUMMARY
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Let's review what we've learned in Chapter 1.

We explored different types of numbers: natural, whole, integers, 
rational, and irrational.

We mastered calculation techniques including estimation, rounding, column 
addition, multiplication, and long division.

We learned about multiples and factors, including how to find the lowest 
common multiple and highest common factor.

And we solved real-world problems using ratios, rates, and proportions.
