## 🔢 Quadratic Equations

### Standard Form
```
ax² + bx + c = 0
```

### Quadratic Formula
```
       -b ± √(b² - 4ac)
x = ─────────────────
            2a
```

### Discriminant (Δ)
```
Δ = b² - 4ac

If Δ > 0  → Two distinct real roots
If Δ = 0  → One repeated root
If Δ < 0  → No real roots (complex roots)
```

### Sum and Product of Roots
```
Sum:     α + β = -b/a
Product: α × β = c/a
```

## 📊 Quadratic Inequalities

### Method
1. Rearrange to form: ax² + bx + c ≤ 0 (or ≥, <, >)
2. Solve ax² + bx + c = 0 to find critical values
3. Test intervals between critical values
4. Choose intervals that satisfy the inequality

### Notation
```
≤ or ≥  →  Closed interval  [a; b]  (include endpoints)
< or >  →  Open interval   (a; b)  (exclude endpoints)
```

## ⚡ Exponent Laws

### Basic Laws
```
1. aᵐ × aⁿ = aᵐ⁺ⁿ         (Add exponents when multiplying)
2. aᵐ ÷ aⁿ = aᵐ⁻ⁿ         (Subtract when dividing)
3. (aᵐ)ⁿ = aᵐⁿ            (Multiply exponents)
4. (ab)ⁿ = aⁿ × bⁿ        (Distribute exponent)
5. (a/b)ⁿ = aⁿ/bⁿ         (Distribute to fraction)
6. a⁰ = 1                 (Anything to power 0 = 1)
7. a⁻ⁿ = 1/aⁿ             (Negative exponent = reciprocal)
8. a^(m/n) = ⁿ√(aᵐ)       (Fractional exponent = root)
```

### Common Powers
```
2¹ = 2      3¹ = 3      5¹ = 5      10¹ = 10
2² = 4      3² = 9      5² = 25     10² = 100
2³ = 8      3³ = 27     5³ = 125    10³ = 1000
2⁴ = 16     3⁴ = 81     5⁴ = 625    10⁴ = 10000
2⁵ = 32     3⁵ = 243
2⁶ = 64     3⁶ = 729
2⁷ = 128
2⁸ = 256
2⁹ = 512
2¹⁰ = 1024
```

## 🔺 Exponential Equations

### Standard Method
1. Express all terms with the **same base**
2. If aᵐ = aⁿ, then m = n
3. Solve for the unknown

### Substitution Method
```
If you see both aˣ and a²ˣ:
Let y = aˣ
Then a²ˣ = (aˣ)² = y²
Solve for y, then find x
```

### Important
```
aˣ > 0 for all real x
(Exponential is ALWAYS positive)
```

---

## √ Surd/Radical Equations

### Method
1. Isolate the square root
2. Square both sides
3. Solve the resulting equation
4. **CHECK all solutions** (squaring can create false solutions)

### Common Simplifications
```
√(a²) = |a|  (absolute value)
√(ab) = √a × √b
√(a/b) = √a / √b
√a + √a = 2√a
√a × √a = a
(√a)² = a  (for a ≥ 0)
```

### Rationalizing Denominators
```
1/√a = √a/a

1/(√a + √b) = (√a - √b)/[(a - b)]  (multiply by conjugate)
```

---

## 🔄 Simultaneous Equations

### Types and Methods

**Two Linear Equations:**
- Substitution
- Elimination

**One Linear + One Non-Linear:**
- **Always use SUBSTITUTION**

### Method (Linear + Quadratic)
1. From linear equation: express y in terms of x (or x in terms of y)
2. Substitute into the non-linear equation
3. Solve the resulting equation
4. Find the other variable
5. **VERIFY** both solutions in both original equations

## 🎯 Common Factorization Patterns

### Difference of Squares
```
a² - b² = (a - b)(a + b)
```

### Perfect Square Trinomials
```
a² + 2ab + b² = (a + b)²
a² - 2ab + b² = (a - b)²
```

### Sum/Difference of Cubes
```
a³ + b³ = (a + b)(a² - ab + b²)
a³ - b³ = (a - b)(a² + ab + b²)
```

### Quadratic Trinomials
```
x² + (a+b)x + ab = (x + a)(x + b)
```

## 📐 Important Domain Restrictions

### Square Roots
```
√x  is defined for  x ≥ 0
```

### Fractions
```
a/b  is defined for  b ≠ 0
```

### Logarithms (Preview for later)
```
log(x)  is defined for  x > 0
```

## 🎓 Exam Tips

1. **Read the question carefully**
   - How many decimal places?
   - What form should the answer be in?

2. **Show ALL working**
   - Marks are for method, not just answer
   - Even if you get the wrong answer, you can get method marks

3. **Check your answers**
   - Substitute back into original equation
   - Does it make sense?

4. **Manage your time**
   - Don't spend too long on one question
   - Move on and come back if stuck

5. **Common errors to avoid**
   - Forgetting to check surd equations
   - Accepting negative values for exponentials
   - Dividing by variable without considering it could be 0
   - Wrong interval notation for inequalities

## 📱 Calculator Tips

**Allowed:**
- Check your answers
- Calculate complicated arithmetic
- Verify decimal approximations

**NOT Allowed (for "without calculator" questions):**
- Must show algebraic working
- Express in exact form (fractions, surds)
- Use exponent laws, not decimal approximations
